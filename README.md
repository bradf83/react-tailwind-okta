# React + TailwindCSS + Okta

## High Level Goals

* Create a layout with TailwindCSS
* Create a better AuthContext with Okta

## Gotcha's So Far

* When setting up TailwindCSS, could not name the `tailwind.config.js` file as `tailwind.js` there is a bug with that name on windows.

## TODO

* Improve use of Tailwind, file a little big not sure we need everything
* Cleanup TODOs about OKTA Pattern
* Access or ID token?  Both?
* Create custom styles files (components/utilities/base);
* Create a DropdownLink, DropdownButton, DropdownDivider
* Dropdown should be something else when small
