# React + TailwindCSS + Okta

## High Level Goals

* Create a layout with TailwindCSS
* Create a better AuthContext with Okta

## Gotcha's So Far

* When setting up TailwindCSS, could not name the `tailwind.config.js` file as `tailwind.js` there is a bug with that name on windows.

## TODO

* Auth with Okta
* Protected and unprotected route
* Context for Auth that wraps entire application
